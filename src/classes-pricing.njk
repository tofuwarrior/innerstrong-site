<h2>Weekly Classes</h2>


<h3>In-person Class</h3>

<p>Thursdays, 7–9 pm at Tremarchog Village Hall, St Nicholas, Goodwick, SA64 0LG.</p>
<p>Bright, welcoming and accessible. There is a mid session break but it is fine to take breaks whenever you need.
<br/>£20/week for the full 2 hour class. 
<strong>No Ongoing Commitment</strong>
<br/>I use an online subscription so that we don't waste time in class dealing with payments but, if you need to stop being part of the class, you can cancel anytime either online or just let me know. <br>Each class is recorded and provided privately to each class member so you can repeat it during the week, or still benefit if you missed the class.</p>

<h3>Online Programmes - Fancy being a pioneer? - If you are you will get extra, direct input.</h3>
<p>In order to fine tune the delivery of the online programmes I am currently recruiting for pioneers to be in the first cohort for these.
<br>Once there is a full cohort of 20 people the first programme will run. 
<br>Once the first cohort is refined, it will continue and the next one with a full cohort will run.</p> 
<p>If you become a pioneer you will .</p> 
<p>The goal of this first cohort is that your feedback will help many people in the future by helping refine the delivery of the course.</p>
<p><strong>For pioneers, the cost will only be £20/week for the online programmes.</strong></p>
<p>If you think you might be interested, just email me at <a href="mailto:pioneers@beinnerstrong.info">pioneers@beinnerstrong.info</a> with your details and we can have a chat to see if it is right for you.</p>

The online courses are focussed on helping three specific client groups.
