<h2>Weekly Classes</h2>


<h3>In-person Class</h3>

<p>Thursdays, 7–9 pm at Tremarchog Village Hall, St Nicholas, Goodwick, SA64 0LG.</p>
<p>Bright, welcoming and accessible. There is a mid session break but it is fine to take breaks whenever you need.
<br/>£20/week for the full 2 hour class. 
<strong>No Commitment</strong>
<br/>I use an online subscription so that we don't waste class time dealing with payments but, if you need to stop coming to class, you can cancel anytime either online or just let me know. Each class is recorded and provided privately to each class member so you can repeat it during the week or still benefit if you missed the class.</p>

<h3>Online Programmes</h3>
<p>I am currently recruiting for pioneers to be in the first cohort for the three online programmes. Once I have a full cohort of 30 people the first programme will run. Once I have refined it, the next one with a full cohort will run.</p> 
<p>If you become a pioneer you will benefit from additional in-person feedback.</p> 
<p>The goal of this phase is that your feedback will help many people in the future by helping refine the delivery of the course.</p>
<p><strong>For pioneers, the cost will only be £20/week for the online programmes.</strong></p>
<p>If you think you might be interested, just email me at <a href="mailto:pioneers@beinnerstrong.info">pioneers@beinnerstrong.info</a> with your details and we can have a chat to see if it is right for you.</p>
