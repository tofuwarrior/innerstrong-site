<h2>Weekly Class Subscription</h2>
<p>£20/week for the full 2 hour class. Pause or cancel anytime. Each class is recorded and provided privately to each class member so you can repeat it dugin the week if you wish.</p>

<h3>In-person Class</h3>
<p>Thursdays, 7–9 pm at Tremarchog Village Hall, St Nicholas, Goodwick, SA64 0LG.</p>
<p>Bright, welcoming and accessible. There is a mid session break but it is fine to take breaks whenever you need.</p>

<h3>Online Programmes</h3>
<p>I am currently recruiting for pioneers to be the first cohort for the three online programmes. Once I have a full cohort of 30 people the programme will run.</p> 
<p>If you become a pioneer you will benefit from additional in-person feedback. Pioneers will also always be given maximum access for the standard price as I develop the courses in future.</p>
<p>The goal is that your feedback will help many people in the future by helping refine the delivery of the course.</p>
<p>For pioneers, the cost will only be £20/week for the online programmes.</p>
<p>If you think you might be interested, just email me at <a href="mailto:pioneers@beinnerstrong.info">pioneers@beinnerstrong.info</a> with your details and we can have a chat.</p>
