							<h2>Online Programmes</h2>
							<p>If you are not able to attend an in person class there are three programmes focussed on specific needs. </p>
						</header>
						<ul class="tabs">
							<li>
								<h3>Health & Teaching Professionals</h3>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Why a Focus on Health, Social and Teaching workers?</h4>
											<p>My mum worked in the NHS all her life so I know how you dedicate yourself to others.<br>
											 My mum could have died due to this; after having to work 24hours straight through, my mum fell sleep driving home and crashed. So I know that too often, the system you work in doesn't care effectively for you. <br>I want to give you skills that will help you neutralise stress so you can feel passionate about your work again and still have the energy you want in your own life.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>What is the Programme?</h4>
											<p>This programme is specifically designed to help you manage the emotional and physical demands of your work in a way that keeps you well and lets you thrive in your personal life.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/hands-holding-sapling-together.jpg" alt="Hands holding a sapling together" /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>How Does it Help?</h4>
											<p>When you deepen your capacity to release stress and tension and you also develop your ability to notice more quickly when you are experiencing stress.  This allows you to continually shift your baseline of nervous system regulation so you feel more deeply regulated more of the time.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>The Result</h4>
											<p>With this course and community of fellow students, you will feel cared for and supported. You will learn skills that move you from stress, burnout or overwhelm to greater feelings of calm, grounded confidence in your work and personal life. </p>
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Freedom from Narcissism</h3>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Why a Focus on Narcisistic Relationships ?</h4>
											<p>I know first hand the damaging effects of being subject to narcissistic control. I also know how I built resilience and set myself free from being controlled. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>What is the Programme?</h4>
											<p>This programme is specifically designed to help you get clarity on how you are being emotionally controlled in the narcissistic relationship and to enable you to free yourself from the emotional responses that keep you trapped in these dynamics.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/balloon-free-in-air.jpg" alt="White balloon floating free in the air" /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>How Does it Help?</h4>
											<p>Narcisistic people control us through our own feelings, fears and reactions, and by distorting our sense of emotional reality so we end up believing that we are the problem. When we are grounded in our body we gain clarity and confidence and are able to act from a place of self-integrity and greater confidence that cannot be controlled.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>The Result</h4>
											<p>With this course and community, you Will feel cared for and supported. You will learn skills that help you gain emotional clarity so you take back control of your emotional state and build the grounded calm & confidence that will help allow you to set yourself free from control.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Stress & Emotional Overwhelm</h3>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>Why a Focus on Stress & Overwhelm?</h4>
											<p>More and more people are struggling to feel at peace inside. Emotional overwhelm, stress, anxiety, fear and excessive anger are now norms in our society. Living like this is stressful and exhausting. This is how I lived before I learned the skills </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>What is the Programme?</h4>
											<p>This programme is specifically designed to help you use the skills of deeper physical release and informed self-care to ground and regulate your nervous system so you feel grounded at peace.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/woman-smiling-asleep.jpg" alt="A young woman relaxed and smiling, asleep on a white pillow " /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h4>How Does it Help?</h4>
											<p>Our nervous system is the lens through which we experience and interpret the world. When we ground our nervous system our entire experience of life changes. Things that previously stressed us feel manageable and we feel a more grounded, confident connection to the people and world around us.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
										<h4>The Result</h4>
										<p>With this course and community, you Will feel cared for and supported. You will learn skills that help you take back control of your emotional state and build a grounded calm & confidence that will enable you to experience your life in a connected confident manner.</p>
