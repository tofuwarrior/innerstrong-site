											<h3>Physical Wellbeing</h3>
											<p>When we are relaxed and present, the body is in the parasympathetic, 'rest and digest' state in which processes that repair and renew our body function best. Being more consistently in this state enhances our ability to stay healthy.</p>

											<h3>Emotional Resilience & Improved Sleep</h3>
											<p>As we learn to use physical release to regulate our nervous system we experience greater calm in the face of things that used to stress us out and we find it easier to achieve good quality sleep.</p>

											<h3>Greater Enjoyment and Connection in your life </h3>
											<p>When our nervous system is in overdrive from stress, high emotion or overstimulation, our attention narrows. When we are more deeply regulated, our attention broadens and deepens allowing us to experince greater breadth and depth of connection with the people in our life and the world around us.</p>

											<h3>Consistent Energy and Focus</h3>
											<p>When the mind and body are relaxed and engaged, we are no longer worn out dealing with stress and tension and have more of our energy and focus available for the things we need them for. </p>

											<h3>Easier self-care</h3>
											<p>When we are well regulated, our deepeer connection with our body & mind makes making good self care decisions much easier; we more naturally choose the thing that is good for us without it being an effort.</p>

							<h2>Caring for the Carers - Health service, Social and Teaching Professionals</h2>
							<br/>
							<h3>Move from exhaustion and burnout to energy, confidence and inner-calm</h3>
							<h4>Why am I so passionate about supporting Health, Social and Teaching professionals?</h4>
								<p>My mum worked in the NHS all her life and, in my acupuncture practise and in classes, I have seen nurses, teachers, physios, radiographers, GPs, anaesthetists, surgeons & social workers.  I know how deeply you dedicate yourself to the service of others and the toll it can take on your own wellbeing.</p>
								<p><strong>My mum could have died due to this dedication</strong><br> After needing to work 24hours straight through, my mum fell sleep driving home and crashed. Thankfully she recovered fine but, I know that too often, despite you giving everything, the system you work in doesn't care effectively for you. </p>
								<p>I know that many of you think about leaving the job you were once passionate about because your wellbeing is being destroyed by it.</p>
								<h4>I feel massively passionate that you, the people who make the world a better place, should be cared for and properly supported</h4>
								<h5> I want to give you the skills, support and community that will help you neutralise stress and keep yourself well, so you can feel passionate about your job and still have the energy you desreve for your own life.</h5>
					
								<p>Join the pioneer programme - get additional personal input for yourself and help refine the programme for others in the future.
