											<h3>Physical Wellbeing</h3>
											<p>When we are relaxed and present, the body is in the parasympathetic, 'rest and digest' state in which processes that repair and renew our body function best. Being more consistently in this state enhances our ability to stay healthy.</p>

											<h3>Greater Enjoyment and Connection in your life </h3>
											<p>When our nervous system is in overdrive from stress, high emotion or overstimulation, our attention narrows. When we are more deeply regulated, our attention broadens, we are able to experince greater breadth and depth of connection with the people in our life and the world around us.</p>
