<h3>What should I bring?</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Bring a drink & a snack if you need one</li>
<li>and an intention to have fun, explore an enjoyable new practise in a supportive environment</li>
</ul>

<h3>What should I wear?</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Loose clothes that allow you to move freely are best but if you can't one week, don't worry.</li>
    <li>It is not esswential but footwear with flat, flexible, thinner soles that allows your toes to spread is better.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Experience required?</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>No — this class is great for beginners.</li>
     <li>If you already have some Tai Chi or Qi Gong experience — this programme is more than just Tai Chi, it contains insights from Neuroscience, behavioural science and Chinese Medical practise, so you will still get a lot from it in additiona to the chance to deepen your personal practise which is always valuable.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why is the class 2 Hours?</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>When you start trying to release physical &amp; emotional tension, it is a process of letting go, it happens gradually much like ripples settling in a pool. Having longer allows our mind and body to engage more deeply into a much more grounded experience which is more satisfying and helps us progress more quickly week to week.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Do I Book/Pay</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Use the link below.</li>
    <li>There is a £20 weekly payment for the full 2 hour class but no ongoing commitment.
    I use a recurring weekly payment to avoid wasting class time dealing with payments but if you need to stop being part of the class, you can cancel anytime online or just let me know.
