        <h2>This brief story is about me — but it’s also about many of us.</h2>
        <p>You might recognise part of yourself in it.</p>
        <p>
             <strong> Its October 2000,  I'm 25 and I'm unhappy.</strong> 
             </br>Nothing in life has taught me how to relax or feel happy & well. 
             </br>I don't even understand right now why I'm not happy; constant emotional and physical tension feel normal,  <br/>— I have some unhealthy coping habits like smoking. 
             <br> I am surviving, definitely not thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Then, something a friend says changes everything.</strong>.
             <br/>I am in the shabby but homely lounge in our shared house, it is a light place, big window, tatty carpet, saggy sofa, white, textured papered walls, the smell of pasta coming from the connected kitchen. 
             <br/>I'm chatting, (moaning if I'm being honest:-) about my unhappiness with my very longstanding friend Geoff and he says something that leads me to a completely different path. 
             <br>Geoff is a bit of a joker, he is often light-hearted, fun with dark hair and often a twinkle in his eye but when its important, he is always there for you because, aswell as the light heartedness, he has a kind empathic heart.
            <br>During the course of the conversation, he says, 'you need to learn to relax', the conversation moves on but afterwards thoe words land like a seed in my mind. 
            <br>Over the following week or so that thought is sitting there and I am starting to realise that I really don't know how to relax.
            </p>
            <p><strong> I wake up to the simple fact that I am quite stressed</strong> 
            <br>It is such a simple realisation but it leads me to sign-up to a Tai Chi taster class run by my amazing soon to become Tai Chi teacher, Christie. 
            <br/>We are in St Mary's church hall, it's more modern than old, it is warm and spacious, the floor is a welcoming warm brown herringbone pattern. There are long curtains keeping the warmth in against the dark, cold, rainy october evening. 
            <br>We have a go at some simple movements in the class and then Christie demonstrates the tai chi short form herself; the short form is a connected sequence of postures that flow from one into another.
            <br><strong> I see her moving, there is this incredible watery flowing quality to her movements, they are so fluid and deeply relaxed but simultaneously they have this incredibly strong looking quality.</strong>
            <br>I have never seen anyone move like that, I was immediately intrigued. 
            <br>I think something inside me just knows that this is what I need.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Over time as I practise, tension starts to leave my body and my nervous system settles.</strong>
             I start to feel lighter, healthier, and more grounded. My focus and confidence develops, as the months pass I feel truly internally connected for the first time since I was a child. This process continues and develops for many years, I become more and more well and Chrisie ecourages me to step up and teaches me how to teach.
             </p>
<p>Experiencing this transformation and the support and care of a committed skilled teacher inspires me to               
           
        
        <p><strong>Another time, if you come to class or start an online programme you will be able to have a wry chuckle at the story of how I ended up allowing someone else to seriously undermine this deep peace and tip me back into reactivity!</strong>. Don't worry, that story of making the same mistake twice is another story that resonates with many of us but it is really about how these skills helped me to regain inner-peace and wellbeing, in the most emotionally demanding of situations and was the experience that gave me a deeper understanding of the the depth and power of learning to release physical tension to regulate your nervous system.</p>

                    <h3>Deeper relaxation and nervous system regulation isn’t a talent, it isn't a fixed feature of your body or personality and it isn't complicated or technical — it’s a practical physical skill, that anyone can learn.<br> You can learn it. </h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <h4>When your body and mind are relaxed and regulated, everything changes.</h4> 
                        <p>All it takes is a willingness to try an enjoyable, welcoming class with a dedicated passionate teacher and then to spend a little bit of time each week giving yourself the proper care and attention you deserve by doing a bit yourself.
                        <br/>You will find what I found, that a really small amount of regular self-focus accumulates into a profoundly positive enhancement to how you experience your life.</p>
