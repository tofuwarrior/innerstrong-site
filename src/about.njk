      <h3>Deeper relaxation and nervous system regulation isn’t a talent.
                    <br>It isn't a fixed feature of your body or personality
                    <br>It isn't complicated or technical</h3>
                    <h2>Deeper relaxation and nervous system regulation is a practical, physical skill, that anyone can learn.<br>You can learn it.

                        <h4>When your body and mind are relaxed and regulated, everything changes.</h4> 
                        <p>All it takes is a willingness to try an enjoyable, welcoming class with a dedicated passionate teacher and then to spend a little bit of time each week giving yourself the proper care and attention you deserve by doing a bit yourself.
                        <strong>You will find what I found, that a really small amount of regular self-focus accumulates into a profoundly positive enhancement in how you experience your life.</strong></p>

        <h2>This brief story is about me — but it’s also about many of us.</h2>
        <p>You might recognise part of yourself in it.</p>
        <p>
             <strong> Its October 2000,  I'm 25 and I'm unhappy.</strong> 
             </br>Nothing in life has taught me how to relax or feel happy & well. 
             </br>I don't even understand right now why I'm not happy; constant emotional and physical tension feel normal,  
             <br/> I have some unhealthy coping habits like smoking. 
             <br> I am surviving, definitely not thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Then, something a friend says changes everything.</strong>
             <br/>I am in the shabby but homely lounge in our shared house, it is a light place, big window, tatty carpet, saggy sofa, white, textured papered walls.
             There is the smell of pasta coming from the connected kitchen and sunlight shafting in through the window.
             <br/>I'm chatting, (moaning if I'm being honest :-) about feeling unhappy with my very longstanding friend Geoff and he says something that leads me to a completely different path.
             </p>
             <p> 
             Geoff is a bit of a joker, he is often light-hearted, he has dark hair and often a twinkle in his eye but when its important, he is always there for you because, aswell as the light heartedness, he has a kind empathic heart.
            <br>During the course of the conversation, he says, <strong>'you need to learn to relax mate'</strong>, the conversation moves on but afterwards those words have stuck, like a seed in my mind. 
            <br>Over the following week or so, that thought is sitting there and I am starting to realise that I really don't know how to relax.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Over that week I wake up to the simple fact that I am quite stressed and I have no idea what to do about it</strong> 
            <br>It is such a simple realisation but it leads me to sign-up to a Tai Chi taster class run by my amazing, soon to become, Tai Chi teacher Christie. 
            <br/>I am in St Mary's church hall in Cardiff, it's more modern than old, warm and spacious, the floor is a welcoming warm brown herringbone pattern. There are long curtains keeping the warmth in against the dark, cold, rainy october evening. The class is busy. 
            <br>We have a go at some simple movements in the class and then Christie demonstrates the tai chi short form herself; the short form is a connected sequence of postures that flow from one into another.
            <br><strong> I see Christie moving and there is this incredible watery flowing quality to her movements, they are so fluid and deeply relaxed but simultaneously they have this incredible robust, strong quality.</strong>
            <br>I have never seen anyone move like this, I am immediately intrigued. 
            <br>I think something deep inside me just knows that this is what I need.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Over time as I practise, tension starts to leave my body and my nervous system settles.</strong>
             I start to feel lighter, healthier, and more grounded. My focus and confidence develops, as the months pass I feel truly internally connected for the first time since I was a child. This process continues and develops for many years, I become more and more well and along the way, Chrisie encourages me to step up and starts to teach me how to teach.
             </p>
<h4>Experiencing this transformation and the support and care of a committed skilled teacher inspires me to dedicate my life to helping others, I also train as an acupuncurist after experiencing first hand the profoundly positive effects of that trusted tradition.</h4>                 
           
        
        <p><strong>Another time, if you come to class or start an online programme, you will be able to have a wry chuckle at the story of how I ended up allowing someone else to seriously undermine this deep peace and tip me back into reactivity!</strong>. Don't worry, that story of making the same mistake twice (which resonates so much with many of us) is really about how these skills helped me to regain inner-peace and wellbeing in the most emotionally demanding of situations.  It was the experience that gave me a deeper understanding of the the true depth and power of learning to release physical tension to regulate your nervous system & emotions and how you can learn to do it even in incredibly adverse circumstances.</p>
