<h3>Why I Am Passionate About Sharing These Practises</h3>
<p>This brief story is about me — but it’s also about many of us. You might recognise yourself in it.
When I was 25, I was tense, stressed, and unhappy. Nothing in life had shown me how to relax or feel happy & well. Constant emotional and physical tension felt normal — I was surviving, not thriving.
</p>
<p>
Then something changed. A good friend pointed it out, and I realised I didn’t know how to relax. I walked into the class of my teacher, Christie, and discovered Tai Chi and Qi Gong — simple, powerful practices that calm the mind and strengthen the body.
</p>
<p>

Over time, I released tension and my nervous system settled. I felt lighter, healthier, and more grounded. My focus and confidence returned, and I felt connected again. That transformation changed my life, and for over 15 years I’ve helped others experience the same shift — from tension and stress to calm strength and genuine wellbeing.
</p>

<h3>Deep relaxation isn’t a talent — it’s a skill anyone can learn.>/h3>

 <h4>When your body and mind are relaxed and regulated, everything changes.</h4> 
 <br/>All it takes is a willingness to begin — to try one enjoyable, welcoming class and then to spend a bit of time giving yourself the proper care and attention you deserve by doing a bit at home.
