        <h2>This brief story is about me — but it’s also about many of us.</h2>
        <p>You might recognise part of yourself in it.</p>
        <p>
            When I was 25, I was tense, stressed, and unhappy. </br>
            Nothing in life had shown me how to relax or feel happy & well. </br>
            Looking back, I didn't even understand why I wasn't happy; constant emotional and physical tension felt normal,  <br/>— I had some unhealthy coping habits and poor self care - I was surviving, definitely not thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then something changed. <br/>I was chatting, (moaning:-) about my situation to my very longstanding friend Geoff and he said something that led me to a completely different path. Geoff is quite a joker, light hearted and fun with dark hair and often a twinkle in his eye but when its important he is always there for you. 
            <br>As we were chatting, he said, 'you need to learn to relax'. The conversation movedon but afterwards thoe words landing like a seed in my mind. 
            <br>Over the following week or so that thought sat there and I started to realise that I really didn’t know how to relax, I was stressed. 
            <br>It was such a simple realisation but it led me to go to a taster class by my amazing Tai Chi teacher, Christie. We had ago but also she demonstrated a little of the tai chi form. 
            <br>I can still see the incredible watery flowing of her movements, they were so fluid and relaxed but also had this incredibly strong feel.
            <br>I had never seen anyone move like that, I was immediately intrigued. 
            <br>I think something inside me just knew that this was what I needed.  So this was where I discovered Tai Chi and Qi Gong — simple, powerful practices that calm the mind and strengthen the body. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time as I practised, and tension started to leave my body and as my nervous system settled. I felt lighter, healthier, and more grounded. My focus and confidence developed, and I felt truly internally connected for the first time since I was a child. That transformation changed my life, and inspired me to dedicate myself to helping others who wanted to be more well, for the last 15 years I’ve helped others experience the same shift — from tension and stress to genuine wellbeing. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Another time, if you come to class you can have a wry chuckle at how I ended up undermining this deep peace but how I used my prior learning to find it again; that story of making the same mistake twice is another story that resonates with many of us BUT I really hope that right now, you will take the same easy, simple step I took, of coming to try out an enjoyable, welcoming, class.

                    <h3>Deeper relaxation and nervous system regulation isn’t a talent, it isn't a fixed feature of your body or personality — it’s a practical skill, that anyone can learn.</h3>

                        <h4>When your body and mind are relaxed and regulated, everything changes.</h4> 
                        <p>All it takes is a willingness to try an enjoyable, welcoming class and then to spend a little bit of time each week giving yourself the proper care and attention you deserve. 
                        <br/>You will find what I found, that a really small amount of regular self-focus accumulates into a profoundly positive enhancement to how you experience your life.</p>
