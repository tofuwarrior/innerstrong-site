            <h4>Why am I passionate about supporting Health, Social and Teaching professionals?</h4>
            <p>My mum worked as a radiographer in the NHS all her life. In my acupuncture practise and in tai chi classes I have seen nurses, teachers, physios, radiographers, GPs, anaesthetists, surgeons & social workers.  I know intimately, how deeply you dedicate yourself to the service of others and the toll it can take on your wellbeing.</p>
                <p><strong>My mum could have died due to this dedication</strong><br> After needing to work 24hours straight through, my mum fell sleep driving home and crashed. Thankfully she recovered fine but, I know that too often, despite you giving everything, the system you work in doesn't care effectively for you. </p>
                <p>I know that many of you think about leaving the job you were once passionate about because your wellbeing is being destroyed by it.
                <h4>I feel massively passionate that you, the people who really make the world a better place, should be cared for and properly supported so you can thrive in your work and lives</h4>
                <h5>I want to give you the skills, support and community that will help you neutralise stress and keep yourself well, so you can feel passionate about your job and still have the energy you want for your own life.</h5>

            <h4>What is the Programme?</h4>
            <p>This programme is specifically designed to help you manage the emotional and physical demands of your work in a way that keeps you well and lets you thrive in your personal life. The programme helps you develop skills and experience community, encouragement and support to keep you motivating and progressing. </p>

            <h4>How Does it Help?</h4>
            <p>When you develop your skill in releasing stress and tension, you also develop your ability to notice more quickly when you are experiencing stress.  This combination allows you to progressively shift the baseline of your nervous system activation so you feel more deeply regulated more of the time. This keeps you out of chronic stress and enables you to stay healthy, happy and well.</p>

            <h4>The Result</h4>

You will learn skills that move you from stress, burnout or overwhelm to feelings of calm, grounded confidence. This will allow you to have confidence and passion in your work and to have the energy you want in your personal life.</p>
